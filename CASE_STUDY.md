# Pokédex Application - Technical Case Study

## Project Overview

Build a Pokédex application using React Native with Expo Web that demonstrates proficiency across the full development stack. The focus is on showcasing technical competency in frontend development, API design, database integration, testing, and deployment practices rather than implementing every possible feature.

*Estimated Timeline:* 3-4 days  
*Reference Design:* https://jordanwhunter.github.io/pokedex/#/

*Note:* Given the time constraint, prioritize demonstrating full-stack capabilities over feature completeness. Not every Pokédex feature needs to be implemented - focus on quality implementation of core functionality.

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend Stack
- React Native with Expo (Web build) ✅
- TypeScript recommended ✅
- Modern UI/UX following the reference design
- Responsive layout for web deployment

### Backend Stack
- REST API (Node.js/Express.js) ✅
- Database integration with caching strategy ✅
- Proxy layer to PokeAPI ✅

### Database & Infrastructure
- Managed database service (Supabase, Neon, or similar) ✅
- Docker containerization
- Kubernetes deployment for the application layer
- GitHub repository with CI/CD pipeline

## Core Functionality

### Required Features (Minimum Viable Product)
1. *Basic Pokémon Display* ✅
   - List view with pagination
   - Individual Pokémon detail pages
   - Basic information display

2. *Search Functionality*  
   - Search by Pokémon name ✅
   - Real-time search results ✅

3. *Data Management*
   - Fetch data from PokeAPI
   - Store in database with basic caching

### Optional Features (Implement if time permits)
1. *Pokémon Search*
   - Auto-suggestions and fuzzy matching
   - Search history management

2. *Advanced Filtering*
   - Filter by Pokémon type(s)
   - Filter by generation
   - Filter by stat ranges
   - Combinable filter options

3. *Sorting Options*
   - Sort by Pokédex number
   - Sort alphabetically
   - Sort by various stats
   - Custom sort preferences

4. *Pokémon Details*
   - Comprehensive detail views
   - Stats visualization
   - Type information and effectiveness
   - Evolution chains
   - Abilities and moves

5. *Comparison Feature*
   - Side-by-side Pokémon comparison
   - Statistical analysis
   - Visual comparison charts
   - Export comparison results

### Performance Requirements
- Lazy loading for large datasets
- Optimized image loading and caching
- Smooth scrolling performance
- Offline capability for cached data

## Architecture Design

### Data Flow Strategy
The application should implement a database-first caching approach:

1. Client requests Pokémon data ✅
2. API checks local database for existing data
3. If data exists and is fresh, return cached version
4. If data is missing or stale, fetch from PokeAPI
5. Store/update data in database before returning to client
6. Implement appropriate cache invalidation strategies

### API Design
Design a RESTful API with the following endpoints:

- GET /api/pokemon - List Pokémon with pagination and filters
- GET /api/pokemon/:id - Get specific Pokémon details
- GET /api/pokemon/search - Search functionality
- GET /api/pokemon/compare - Compare multiple Pokémon
- Additional endpoints as needed for types, generations, etc.

### Database Schema
Design an efficient schema to store:
- Pokémon basic information ✅
- Stats and abilities ✅
- Type relationships
- Sprite URLs and image data
- Metadata for cache management

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend Components
Create reusable, well-structured components:
- Pokémon card components for list views
- Detail view components with tabbed interfaces
- Search and filter components
- Comparison interface components
- Loading states and error boundaries

### Performance Optimization
- Implement virtual scrolling for large lists
- Use appropriate image optimization techniques
- Implement debounced search functionality
- Cache API responses on the client side
- Optimize bundle size and loading times

### Error Handling
- Graceful handling of API failures
- Offline state management
- User-friendly error messages
- Loading states and skeleton screens

## Testing Strategy

### End-to-End Testing
Implement basic E2E tests covering core user flows:
- Basic search functionality
- Navigation to Pokémon details
- Error scenarios (e.g., network failures)

*Note:* Comprehensive test coverage is not required - focus on demonstrating testing competency with key scenarios.

*Testing Tools:* Playwright is recommended for E2E testing, though alternative solutions are acceptable if properly justified.

### Additional Testing
- Basic unit tests for key utility functions
- API endpoint testing for core routes
- Database connectivity testing

## Deployment & DevOps

### Containerization
- Create production-ready Dockerfile
- Optimize image size and security
- Include proper health checks
- Environment variable management

### Kubernetes Deployment
- Basic application deployment to Kubernetes
- Essential configurations (service, deployment)
- Environment variable management
- Basic health checks

### CI/CD Pipeline
- GitHub Actions workflow for automated testing
- Automated E2E test execution
- Docker image building and pushing
- Deployment automation to Kubernetes
- Environment-specific configurations

### Database Integration
- Use managed database service (Supabase/Neon/similar)
- Implement proper connection pooling
- Database migration strategy
- Backup and monitoring considerations

## Project Structure & Best Practices
