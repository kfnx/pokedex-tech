## Testing Strategy

### End-to-End Testing
Implement basic E2E tests covering core user flows:
- Basic search functionality
- Navigation to Pok√©mon details
- Error scenarios (e.g., network failures)

*Note:* Comprehensive test coverage is not required - focus on demonstrating testing competency with key scenarios.

*Testing Tools:* Playwright is recommended for E2E testing, though alternative solutions are acceptable if properly justified.

### Additional Testing
- Basic unit tests for key utility functions
- API endpoint testing for core routes
- Database connectivity testing
